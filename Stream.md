## Streams 

- In Node.js, a stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data. Streams are used to read or write data sequentially, one piece at a time, rather than loading an entire dataset into memory all at once. Streams can be used for a variety of purposes, such as processing large amounts of data, reading and writing files, and streaming data over a network connection.

There are four types of streams in Node.js:

Readable streams: used for reading data
Writable streams: used for writing data
Duplex streams: used for both reading and writing data
Transform streams: a type of duplex stream that transforms the data as it is being read or written
Streams use events to signal when data is available to read, when a stream is finished, when an error occurs, and other events. The key advantage of using streams is that they allow you to work with large datasets efficiently, without having to load everything into memory at once.

In summary, streams in Node.js provide a powerful and efficient way to work with streaming data by allowing you to process data in small, manageable chunks, without having to load all the data into memory at once.
